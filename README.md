# MEP Activity Analyser 📊

This repository is designed to analyse the activities of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). We study their background, statements, and parliamentary activities.

The analyzing models take into account various factors such as:
- **Origin** of the individual 🌍
- **Sociological group affiliation** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- **Ideology** 🧠
- **Statements** (including their timeliness and platform) 🗣️
- **Voting history** 🗳️

Using the insights from these models, we can:

- **Predict an individual's position** on specific issues 🔮
- **Forecast voting outcomes** for the entire parliament 🏛️
- **Identify individuals with similar views** 🔍
- **Spot unusual political decisions** (potential misclicks, corruption, populism, etc.) ⚠️
- **Predict which viewpoints are most critical** for specific votes ⚖️
